# React Query useInfiniteQuery() example with React Native's Flatlist

## Tech Used
1. [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) to easily get started with React Native
2. [TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) for type safety + demonstations of types
3. [React Query](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-query) + custom React hook pattern for cleaner components

## Get Started
1. Git clone this project and run `yarn install` to install dependencies
2. Download the Expo Go app if you haven't already
3. Run `yarn start` and open Expo Go
4. The project should show up there and you can click to open it!

## Coming Soon...
When I get a chance, I'll make pure JS version of this so I can host it on Expo's Snack service
